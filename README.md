Abstract
Edge computing devices ideally need to process large amounts of sensor data and execute machine learning models in real-time. Deploying deep learning algorithms can be challenging in energy-constrained nodes with limited computational capacity, when using lightweight classification algorithms is essential. Decision Tree (DT) algorithms require fewer computational resources than Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) while maintaining similar accuracy. However, implementing DTs on FPGAs becomes difficult as the number of nodes increases. This work proposes a framework for automatically generating Hardware Description Language (HDL) code for binary decision trees, simplifying their deployment on FPGAs or ASICs. Results from HDL and Python simulations demonstrate that both full-precision DTs and 8-bit quantized DTs achieve the same level of accuracy (99\% for detection and 81\% for classification) as ANNs with more than five hidden neurons.
